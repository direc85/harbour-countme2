# harbour-countme2
CountMe 2 is a simple counter application for Sailfish OS. It has two counter next to each other, which can be incremented or decremented by one using the buttons.

I created this as an excersize in creating and publishing an application in Jolla Store, but it does not mean that I'm done with this. Keep your ideas coming!
